Students often struggle in math classes  because of content errors. Path Finder is a website that allows students to solve their way through math problems, identify any weaknesses, and eliminate them for free. For example, if a student is struggling with a tricky math problem, instead of giving up or paying extra for a tutor, they can press the 'Struggling' button on our website, upload an image of their math problem, and get instant feedback. Our website will provide them with an answer and helpful resources, such as Khan Academy videos, that they can use to learn the topic in the future. Once they have achieved mastery of a type of question, they can continue by pressing the 'Practice' button,and uploading a picture for similar problems. Currently, we are working to generate practice problems to help prepare users for  upcoming exams. Our future goal is to combine OCR models and Machine Learning to create a even faster and effortless system that can strengthen any student's academic journey. Accessibility is a must, so join Path Finder today.
